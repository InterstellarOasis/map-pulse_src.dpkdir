pulse - BETA 2 (build 70) ( 2006.06.06 )
-----------------------------

This is the 2nd public beta release of this map, remember to give me a lot of feedback about:
 - gameplay
 - layout
 - graphics (brightness, missing textures, textures alignments that go wrong, ... )
 - bugs

KNOWN ISSUES:
============
- fps: I am working on map optimizations.
- lights: some places are too dark, I will try to find a good brightness level for the map.
- start points: I will modify them in the BETA 3, any suggestions are wellcome.
